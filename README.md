#GoBit
**A Chess program in Go**

This is from a Youtube serie that explains the steps in building a fairly strong chess engine. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsQEf3a1WvsgWTjzqNMkRjA/featured?view_as=public

The Program will be featuring state of the art search techniques and is based on bitboards. Magic numbers for bitBoards will be used for move generation.

The Go-code from the video clip will be tagged and released here in Github. Sometimes in groups.

Please be aware of that the releases are not very useful taking out of context (the videos) but after about 25-30 videos the releases will be more of a chess playing program.
